# example_for_intership
Here is some examples of my codes. 

Half of them - My job for STELLARIUM team. It is system of movement. Switching heroes making them following different scripts depending on which character is currently active (scrip status "passive" and "play")

The other half is my works from CS50 Harvard course about coding basics on the C language. 
Check second branch too, please.
